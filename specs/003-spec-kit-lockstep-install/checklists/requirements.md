# Specification Quality Checklist: Spec-Kit Lockstep Installation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec focuses on WHAT and WHY without specifying HOW. References to "package manager" in dependencies are appropriately vague and don't commit to specific technologies.

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories articulate clear value propositions (eliminating version conflicts, ensuring compatibility, smooth upgrades).

✅ **Non-technical language**: Written to be understandable by product managers and stakeholders without deep technical knowledge.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Dependencies) are fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No clarification markers**: The specification makes reasonable assumptions documented in the Dependencies section. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present.

✅ **Testable requirements**: All 10 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010) are verifiable and testable. Each can be validated through automated tests or manual verification.

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 7 success criteria include specific metrics:
- SC-001: Single command execution (qualitative)
- SC-002: 95% success rate (quantitative)
- SC-003: 100% conflict detection (quantitative)
- SC-004: 100% backward compatibility (quantitative)
- SC-005: Under 5 seconds (quantitative)
- SC-006: 90% self-service success (quantitative)
- SC-007: Zero breaking changes (quantitative)

✅ **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes without specifying implementation technologies.

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each of 3 user stories includes 3 acceptance scenarios with Given-When-Then format (total: 9 scenarios).

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 6 edge cases covering failure modes, conflicts, permissions, and cross-platform concerns.

✅ **Scope bounded**: Clear focus on lockstep installation, version management, and upgrade paths. Excludes unrelated features.

✅ **Dependencies documented**: External dependencies, assumptions, and constraints clearly listed.

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Requirements with acceptance criteria**: All functional requirements are paired with acceptance scenarios in user stories.

✅ **Primary flows covered**: Three prioritized user stories (P1-P3) cover installation, maintenance, and upgrade flows.

✅ **Measurable outcomes aligned**: Success criteria directly map to user stories and functional requirements.

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains abstraction level appropriate for planning phase.

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` commands.

### Strengths

1. Clear prioritization of user stories (P1-P3) enables incremental delivery
2. Comprehensive edge case analysis anticipates failure modes
3. Quantitative success criteria provide objective validation targets
4. Well-documented assumptions reduce ambiguity
5. Technology-agnostic approach allows implementation flexibility

### Recommendations

None required. Specification meets all quality criteria for progression to planning phase.
