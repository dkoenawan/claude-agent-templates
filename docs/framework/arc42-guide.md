# Arc42 Documentation Framework Guide

## Overview

Arc42 is a proven template for documenting software and system architectures. This guide explains how our agents (requirements-analyst, solution-architect, and documentation) use arc42 principles to create consistent, comprehensive documentation.

## Framework Structure

Arc42 addresses two fundamental questions:
- **What** should be documented about architecture?
- **How** should architecture be documented?

## Core Sections

### 1. Introduction & Goals
**Purpose**: Define the system's purpose and key quality requirements
- Business requirements and features
- Quality goals (performance, security, usability)
- Key stakeholders and their concerns

### 2. Constraints
**Purpose**: Document limitations that influence architectural decisions
- Organizational constraints (team structure, processes)
- Technical constraints (existing systems, standards)
- Conventions and requirements

### 3. Context & Scope
**Purpose**: Establish system boundaries and external interfaces
- Business context (users, external systems)
- Technical context (infrastructure, protocols)
- System boundaries and scope

### 4. Solution Strategy
**Purpose**: Summarize fundamental architectural approach
- Technology decisions and rationale
- Top-level decomposition strategies
- Achieving quality goals approach

### 5. Building Block View
**Purpose**: Static system structure and decomposition
- High-level system overview
- Component breakdowns and responsibilities
- Interface definitions

### 6. Runtime View
**Purpose**: Dynamic behavior and key scenarios
- Critical use cases and scenarios
- System interactions and workflows
- Runtime behavior patterns

### 7. Deployment View
**Purpose**: Technical infrastructure and system deployment
- Infrastructure landscape
- Mapping software to infrastructure
- Deployment strategies

### 8. Crosscutting Concepts
**Purpose**: Overarching principles and recurring patterns
- Domain concepts and patterns
- Security concepts
- Architecture and design patterns

### 9. Architectural Decisions
**Purpose**: Document critical design choices
- Decision records with rationale
- Trade-offs and alternatives considered
- Impact and consequences

### 10. Quality Requirements
**Purpose**: Define and detail quality goals
- Quality scenarios and requirements
- Quality tree structure
- Testing strategies

### 11. Risks & Technical Debt
**Purpose**: Identify potential problems and challenges
- Known technical risks
- Technical debt items
- Mitigation strategies

### 12. Glossary
**Purpose**: Define domain and technical terminology
- Domain-specific terms
- Technical abbreviations
- Shared vocabulary

## Agent Integration

### Requirements Analyst Usage
- **Focus Sections**: 1 (Introduction & Goals), 2 (Constraints), 3 (Context & Scope)
- **Approach**: Use structured questioning to fill these sections
- **Output**: Arc42-structured requirements documentation

### Solution Architect Usage
- **Focus Sections**: 4 (Solution Strategy), 5 (Building Block View), 9 (Architectural Decisions)
- **Approach**: Create technical plans following arc42 structure
- **Output**: Comprehensive architectural documentation

### Documentation Agent Usage
- **Focus Sections**: All sections for final documentation
- **Approach**: Compile and format complete arc42 documentation
- **Output**: Complete project architecture documentation

## Implementation Guidelines

### Progressive Disclosure
- Start with essential sections (1, 3, 4, 5)
- Add detail sections as needed (6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12)
- Maintain flexibility for project-specific needs

### Quality Standards
- Clear, concise language
- Stakeholder-appropriate detail level
- Visual diagrams where helpful
- Regular updates and maintenance

## Adaptation Notes

This framework is adapted for our GitHub issue-driven workflow:
- Sections are progressively built through agent collaboration
- GitHub issues serve as the primary collaboration medium
- Documentation evolves through agent handoffs
- Final output consolidates all agent contributions
