# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for contributing to Claude Agent Templates! This guide will help you create high-quality agent templates that benefit the entire community.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Experience using Claude Code with agents
- Understanding of the specific domain/technology you're creating an agent for
- Familiarity with our [Agent Writing Guide](agent-guide.md)

### Development Environment
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) for cross-platform automation
4. Run `task install` to set up agents locally
5. Create a feature branch from `main`

## Contribution Process

### 1. Choose Your Contribution Type

#### New Agent Template
- Identify a gap in existing agents
- Focus on specific, well-defined use cases
- Ensure it's different enough from existing agents

#### Agent Improvement  
- Enhance existing agent functionality
- Fix bugs or unclear instructions
- Improve performance or accuracy

#### Documentation Update
- Clarify existing documentation
- Add examples or use cases
- Fix typos or formatting issues

### 2. Follow Our Development Workflow

#### Branch Strategy
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/agent-name

# Or for improvements
git checkout -b fix/improve-code-reviewer
```

#### Branch Naming Conventions
- `feature/agent-name` - New agents
- `fix/issue-description` - Bug fixes or improvements  
- `docs/topic-name` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/component-name` - Code restructuring

### 3. Agent Development Standards

#### Template Structure
Every agent must follow this structure:
```markdown
---
name: descriptive-agent-name
description: "Clear, concise description of when to use this agent"
tools: Tool1, Tool2, Tool3  # Only tools actually needed
---

Your agent's system prompt here.
```

#### Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `code-reviewer`, `test-writer`
- Be specific: `python-security-auditor` not `security-agent`
- Avoid redundant words: `reviewer` not `code-review-agent`

#### Description Requirements
```markdown
# Good descriptions
description: "Specialized React component code reviewer focusing on hooks, performance, and TypeScript best practices"
description: "Python test writer using pytest, creating comprehensive unit and integration tests"

# Poor descriptions  
description: "Reviews code"
description: "Helps with testing stuff"
```

## Quality Standards

### Agent Requirements

#### ‚úÖ Must Have
- **Clear purpose** - Specific, well-defined role
- **Focused scope** - Not trying to do everything
- **Appropriate tools** - Only tools actually needed
- **Tested functionality** - Works reliably in real projects
- **Educational value** - Teaches good practices
- **Professional tone** - Constructive and helpful

#### ‚ùå Must Avoid
- **Overly broad scope** - "Does everything" agents
- **Unclear instructions** - Vague or ambiguous prompts
- **Excessive tool permissions** - More tools than needed
- **Duplicate functionality** - Too similar to existing agents
- **Untested behavior** - Not validated in real scenarios
- **Condescending tone** - Negative or judgmental language

### Testing Requirements

#### 1. Multi-Project Testing
Test your agent with:
- **Different project sizes** - Small scripts to large applications
- **Various architectures** - Monoliths, microservices, libraries
- **Different team contexts** - Solo projects, team codebases
- **Edge cases** - Empty files, legacy code, incomplete features

#### 2. Real-World Validation
```markdown
## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Tested on at least 3 different projects
- [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully  
- [ ] Provides consistent, helpful output
- [ ] Respects tool limitations
- [ ] Works with team workflows
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
```

#### 3. Documentation Testing
- Instructions are clear and complete
- Examples work as described
- Links are functional
- Code samples are correct

## Submission Process

### 1. Pre-Submission Checklist
- [ ] Agent follows template structure
- [ ] Tested thoroughly in multiple contexts
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] No duplicate functionality with existing agents
- [ ] Follows naming conventions
- [ ] Tool permissions are minimal and appropriate

### 2. Pull Request Requirements

#### PR Title Format
```
Add [agent-name] agent for [specific use case]
Fix [agent-name] agent [specific issue]
Update [component] documentation
```

#### PR Description Template
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of what this PR adds/changes.

## Agent Details
- **Name**: agent-name
- **Purpose**: Specific use case this agent addresses
- **Tools Used**: List of tools and why they're needed
- **Target Users**: Who will benefit from this agent

## Testing
- [ ] Tested on multiple projects
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Documentation tested
- [ ] Performance validated

## Examples
Provide examples of the agent in action (screenshots/outputs if helpful).

## Related Issues
Fixes #123
Relates to #456
```

### 3. Review Process

#### What We Look For
1. **Functionality** - Does the agent work as intended?
2. **Quality** - Is the code/documentation well-written?
3. **Uniqueness** - Does it add value beyond existing agents?
4. **Testing** - Is it thoroughly validated?
5. **Documentation** - Is it well-documented?

#### Feedback and Iteration
- Address reviewer feedback promptly
- Be open to suggestions and improvements
- Update documentation as needed
- Retest after making changes

## Community Standards

### Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and constructive in all interactions
- Focus on the work, not the person
- Welcome newcomers and help them learn
- Celebrate diversity of perspectives and approaches

### Communication Guidelines
- **Issues**: Use for bugs, feature requests, and questions
- **Discussions**: Use for broader conversations and ideas
- **Pull Requests**: Keep focused and include context
- **Reviews**: Be constructive and educational

## Advanced Contributions

### 1. Agent Categories
Help organize agents into logical categories:

**Core (Language-Agnostic):**
- **Workflow Management** - Requirements analysis, architecture planning, documentation
- **Project Operations** - Issue management, release planning, cleanup

**Technology-Specific:**
- **Python** - Testing, implementation, security, performance
- **JavaScript** - Frontend development, Node.js backend, testing
- **DevOps** - Deployment, infrastructure, monitoring, automation
- **Security** - Vulnerability scanning, compliance, auditing

### 2. Example Projects
Create comprehensive examples showing agents in action:
```
examples/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ react-app/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/agents/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ python-api/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/agents/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### 3. Automation and Tools
We use a unified Taskfile-based system for repository automation:

**Available Commands:**
- `task install` - Install all agents to ~/.claude/agents
- `task list` - Show available and installed agents
- `task validate` - Verify agent installation
- `task clean` - Remove installed agents
- `task help` - Show detailed usage information

**Legacy Compatibility:**
Existing platform-specific scripts (`scripts/install-agents.sh`, `scripts/install-agents.bat`) are maintained for backward compatibility but new development should use the Taskfile system.
