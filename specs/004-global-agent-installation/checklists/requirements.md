# Specification Quality Checklist: Global Agent Installation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED (All items pass)

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: The specification focuses on what the system should do (embed source files, install to ~/.claude/) without specifying how (no mention of specific Go packages, file formats, or algorithms beyond required dependencies)

✅ **User value focus**: All user stories are framed from developer perspective with clear business benefits (reduced installation complexity, cross-repository consistency, offline support)

✅ **Non-technical language**: Specification avoids jargon and explains features in terms of user actions and outcomes

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: All required sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are fully populated

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No clarifications needed**: All requirements are concrete and specific with no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each functional requirement can be verified (e.g., FR-001 can be tested by running installer without repository, FR-003 can be verified by checking ~/.claude/agents/)

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All criteria include specific metrics (SC-001: under 2 minutes, SC-003: under 20MB, SC-008: >99% success rate)

✅ **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria focus on user-facing outcomes (installation time, accessibility, reliability) rather than implementation details

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: Each user story includes 3 Given-When-Then scenarios covering primary flows

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 7 edge cases documented covering permissions, conflicts, interruptions, and dual installations

✅ **Scope bounded**: Clear In Scope / Out of Scope sections with 8 in-scope items and 8 out-of-scope items

✅ **Dependencies documented**: 5 dependencies identified including Go embed package, GitHub releases, version lock system, Claude Code discovery, and cross-platform APIs

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each of 16 functional requirements is testable and verifiable

✅ **Primary flows covered**: 4 user stories span installation (P1), updates (P2), cross-repository usage (P1), and offline support (P3)

✅ **Measurable outcomes**: 9 success criteria cover performance, reliability, compatibility, and usability

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification maintains separation between requirements (what/why) and implementation (how)

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command
- All quality criteria pass without modifications needed
- Priority ordering (2 P1 stories, 1 P2, 1 P3) appropriately reflects feature criticality
- Assumptions section documents 7 key constraints that will inform implementation planning
- Dependencies section identifies Go embed package as primary technical requirement while keeping spec technology-agnostic
