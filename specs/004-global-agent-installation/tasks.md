# Tasks: Global Agent Installation + Repository Setup

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/004-global-agent-installation/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/
**Feature Branch**: `004-global-agent-installation`

**Tests**: Not explicitly requested in spec - implementation only

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Go project structure: `cmd/`, `internal/`, `pkg/` at repository root
- Tests: `tests/integration/` for integration tests
- Embedded files: `agents/`, `.specify/` (embedded via go:embed)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational - Core MVP functionality
- **User Story 3 (Phase 4)**: Depends on US1 completion - Extends global installation
- **User Story 4 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational - Can run in parallel with US1/US3
- **User Story 2 (Phase 6)**: Depends on US1 and US3 completion - Extends with updates
- **User Story 5 (Phase 7)**: Depends on US2 completion - Extends with offline support
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ MVP
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: Depends on User Story 1 - Extends global installation to work across repos
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent from US1/US3 (different functionality)
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on User Stories 1 and 3 - Adds update capability to global installation
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Depends on User Story 2 - Extends update with offline support

### Within Each User Story

- Foundational infrastructure before specific features
- Models and data structures before business logic
- Core logic before CLI commands
- Implementation before integration tests
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: T002, T003 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: T006-T009, T019-T020 can run in parallel (different packages)
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: T021-T022 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 5 (US4)**: T037-T038 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 6 (US2)**: T047-T051 can run in parallel (different files in download package)
- **Phase 7 (US5)**: T065-T066 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 8 (Polish)**: T071-T075, T078-T079, T080-T083 can run in parallel (different concerns)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (Global Installation)

```bash
# Launch foundational tasks in parallel:
Task: "Implement Go embed directives for agents/, .specify/ in internal/embed/embed.go"
Task: "Implement EmbeddedFiles interface: GetAgents() in internal/embed/embed.go"
Task: "Implement EmbeddedFiles interface: GetSpecify() in internal/embed/embed.go"
Task: "Implement EmbeddedFiles interface: GetCommands() in internal/embed/embed.go"

# Then launch US1 implementation tasks in parallel:
Task: "Implement source selection logic with embedded fallback in internal/install/detect.go"
Task: "Implement pre-installation validation (disk space, permissions) in internal/install/validate.go"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 3, 4 - All P1)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Global Installation) ‚Üí **TEST INDEPENDENTLY**
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 3 (Repository-Independent Usage) ‚Üí **TEST INDEPENDENTLY**
5. Complete Phase 5: User Story 4 (Repository Setup) ‚Üí **TEST INDEPENDENTLY**
6. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test all P1 user stories work together
7. Deploy/demo if ready

**Rationale**: All three P1 stories are critical for the complete feature. US1 enables global installation, US3 validates cross-repository access, US4 enables GitHub automation. Together they form the complete MVP.

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Phase 1-2** ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. **Phase 3 (US1)** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (basic global install works)
3. **Phase 4 (US3)** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (cross-repo usage validated)
4. **Phase 5 (US4)** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (repository setup works)
5. **Phase 6 (US2)** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (updates work)
6. **Phase 7 (US5)** ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy (offline support)
7. **Phase 8** ‚Üí Final polish and documentation

Each phase adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **All team members** complete Phase 1-2 together (foundational)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T021-T030)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 4 (T037-T046) - Can run in parallel with US1
   - **Developer C**: Prepare User Story 3 prerequisites
3. After US1 complete:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 3 (T031-T036) - Extends US1
   - **Developer B**: Continue US4 or start US2 prep
4. After US3 complete:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 2 (T047-T064)
   - **Developer B**: User Story 5 or Polish
5. Stories integrate naturally through shared interfaces

## Technical Notes

### Go Embed Package Usage

```go
// internal/embed/embed.go
package embed

import "embed"

//go:embed agents/* .specify/*
var embeddedFiles embed.FS

// Access via fs.FS interface
func GetAgents() (fs.FS, error) {
    return fs.Sub(embeddedFiles, "agents")
}
```

### Build-Time Version Injection

```bash
# scripts/build-with-embed.sh
VERSION=$(git describe --tags --always)
BUILD_TIME=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)

go build -ldflags="-X main.Version=$VERSION -X main.BuildTime=$BUILD_TIME" \
    -o bin/spec-kit-agents ./cmd/spec-kit-agents/
```

### Installation Paths

- **Global**: `~/.claude/agents/cat-*.md`, `~/.claude/commands/speckit.*.md`
- **Repository**: `{repo}/.specify/`, `{repo}/.github/workflows/`, `{repo}/specs/`
- **Version Locks**: `~/.claude/.version-lock.json` (global), `{repo}/.version-lock.json` (local)

### Archive Format Detection

- **Linux/macOS**: Download `spec-kit-agents-sources-v{version}.tar.gz`
- **Windows**: Download `spec-kit-agents-sources-v{version}.zip`
- Auto-detect based on `runtime.GOOS`

---

## Success Metrics (from spec.md)

- **SC-001**: Global installation completes in < 2 minutes (validate with T080)
- **SC-002**: Agent invocation latency < 500ms (validate with T085)
- **SC-003**: Binary size < 20MB with embedded files (validate with T084)
- **SC-004**: 100% of agents function identically (validate with T080-T083)
- **SC-005**: Updates succeed with 99% rollback success (validate with T082)
- **SC-010**: Repository setup completes in < 1 minute (validate with T083)
- **SC-011**: Setup creates all directories 100% of the time (validate with T083)

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- All paths use forward slashes (Go convention, works on all platforms)
- Binary embedding increases size by ~1.5MB (well within 20MB budget)
- Tests are NOT included in this implementation (not requested in spec)
