# Tasks: Spec-Kit Lockstep Installation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-spec-kit-lockstep-install/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Included (TDD approach per constitution)

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Single Command Installation)
- Delivers core value: one-liner installation with lockstep version management
- Fully testable independently
- Foundation for US2 and US3

**Incremental Delivery**:
1. US1 (P1): Single command installation ‚Üí Deploy to early adopters
2. US2 (P2): Version compatibility management ‚Üí Enable maintainers
3. US3 (P3): Upgrade path management ‚Üí Complete feature set

   - pkg/models/manifest_test.go
   - pkg/models/lock_test.go
   - internal/version/compare_test.go
   - internal/install/detect_test.go
   - All other *_test.go files
