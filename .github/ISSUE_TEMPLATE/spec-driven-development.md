# Migrate to Spec-Driven Development Workflow

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenge: Contract Alignment in Human-in-the-Loop Process

Our current GitHub issue-driven workflow relies on **narrative documentation** (Arc42) and **human interpretation** at each handoff point. While this enables rich collaboration, it creates several challenges:

1. **Contract Ambiguity**: Natural language requirements leave room for interpretation differences between agents
2. **Validation Gaps**: No automated way to verify if implementation matches requirements
3. **Test Generation**: Tests are manually planned rather than derived from specifications
4. **Agent Drift**: Each agent interprets requirements differently, leading to misalignment

### Example Scenario
When a user requests "CRUD for Notion":
- Requirements Analyst interprets this one way
- Solution Architect designs based on their interpretation
- Test Engineer creates tests based on their understanding
- Software Engineer implements their interpretation

Without formal specifications, we rely on human review to catch misalignments.

## Proposed Solution: Hybrid Spec-Driven Approach

Integrate **executable specifications** into our existing workflow while maintaining human collaboration benefits:

```
Current:  Issue → Requirements → Architecture → Test → Implementation
Enhanced: Issue → Requirements → SPEC → Architecture (validates spec) → Test (from spec) → Implementation (to spec)
```

### Key Benefits
- **Single Source of Truth**: Specifications define exact contracts all agents must follow
- **Automated Validation**: Code can be verified against specs programmatically
- **Test Generation**: Tests derived directly from specifications
- **Maintains Human Touch**: Specs augment rather than replace Arc42 documentation

## Proposed Implementation

### Phase 1: Spec Integration Foundation (Week 1-2)
Enhance existing agents to generate and consume specifications alongside Arc42 docs:

1. **Requirements Analyst Enhancement**
   - Add spec generation capability (OpenAPI, JSON Schema, Protocol classes)
   - Generate specs from Arc42 sections 1-3
   - Include spec validation with user

2. **Create Spec Writer Utility Agent**
   - Specialized agent for converting requirements to formal specs
   - Supports multiple spec formats (OpenAPI, Gherkin, Protocols)
   - Can be invoked by Requirements Analyst

### Phase 2: Spec Consumption (Week 3-4)
Modify downstream agents to use specifications:

3. **Solution Architect Updates**
   - Validate specs are implementable
   - Refine specs based on architectural constraints
   - Generate port/adapter contracts from specs

4. **Test Engineer Transformation**
   - Generate test cases from specifications
   - Create contract tests for interfaces
   - Validate coverage against spec requirements

5. **Software Engineer Integration**
   - Implement code to satisfy specifications
   - Run spec validation as part of implementation
   - Generate implementation from specs where possible

### Phase 3: Workflow Orchestration (Week 5-6)

6. **GitHub Workflow Integration**
   - Add spec validation gates to issue workflow
   - Create spec storage in `specs/` directory
   - Link specs to issues and PRs

7. **Agent Organization Restructure**
   ```
   agents/
   ├── workflow/           # Issue-driven agents
   │   ├── requirements-analyst/
   │   └── documentation/
   ├── specification/      # NEW: Spec-focused agents
   │   ├── spec-writer/
   │   └── spec-validator/
   ├── architecture/       # Design agents
   │   ├── solution-architect/
   │   └── framework-architect/
   └── implementation/     # Execution agents
       ├── software-engineer-python/
       └── test-engineer-python/
   ```

## Implementation Tasks

### Immediate Actions
- [ ] Create spec-writer agent based on GitHub Spec Kit approach
- [ ] Update requirements-analyst to optionally generate specs
- [ ] Create `specs/` directory structure and templates
- [ ] Document spec formats and when to use each

### Agent Updates
- [ ] Enhance requirements-analyst with spec generation
- [ ] Update solution-architect to validate/refine specs
- [ ] Transform test-engineer to generate from specs
- [ ] Modify software-engineer to implement against specs
- [ ] Create spec-validator utility agent

### Workflow Integration
- [ ] Define spec validation gates in workflow
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions for spec verification
- [ ] Update issue templates to include spec options
- [ ] Document hybrid workflow in main README

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Reorganize agents into logical folders
- [ ] Create shared spec utilities/templates
- [ ] Set up spec validation tooling
- [ ] Create example specs for common patterns

## Success Criteria
- Agents can generate and consume formal specifications
- Specifications coexist with Arc42 documentation
- Tests can be generated from specifications
- Implementation can be validated against specs
- Human collaboration remains central to workflow

## Questions for Discussion
1. Should we mandate specs for all issues or make them optional?
2. Which spec formats should we prioritize (OpenAPI, Gherkin, Protocols)?
3. How do we handle legacy issues without specs?
4. Should spec generation be a separate agent or built into requirements-analyst?
