### Added
- **Cross-Platform Automation System**
  - Unified `Taskfile.yml` with comprehensive task definitions
  - `task install` - Install all agents to ~/.claude/agents directory
  - `task list` - Display available and installed agents with status
  - `task clean` - Remove installed agents with user confirmation
  - `task validate` - Verify agent installation and file integrity

  - Created `docs/changelog/` directory for migration documentation
  - Added comprehensive `LICENSE.md` with MIT license
  - Structured documentation hierarchy for better organization

- **Documentation Improvements**
  - Updated `CLAUDE.md` with installation instructions and version information
  - Enhanced `docs/contributing.md` with Taskfile workflow integration
  - Added version consistency across all documentation files

### Changed
- **Installation Process**
  - Primary installation method now uses `task install` (cross-platform)
  - Legacy scripts (`install-agents.sh`, `install-agents.bat`) maintained for backward compatibility
  - Unified command interface regardless of operating system

- **Project Organization**
  - Moved `TASKFILE_MIGRATION.md` to `docs/changelog/` for better organization
  - Standardized documentation formatting and structure
  - Enhanced .gitignore to exclude Task binary (`bin/task`)

### Infrastructure
