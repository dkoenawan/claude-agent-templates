# Research: Agent Refactoring for Spec-Driven Development

## Research Overview
Research findings for refactoring existing agents to follow specification-driven development approach with GitHub Issues interface, specialized by role and domain/tech stack.

## Current Agent Analysis

### Existing Agent Structure
- **Location**: `/agents/core/` and `/agents/python/`
- **Current Agents**: requirements-analyst, solution-architect, test-engineer-python, software-engineer-python, documentation
- **Format**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- **Integration**: GitHub issue-driven workflow already implemented

### Current Capabilities Assessment
- ✅ **GitHub Integration**: Agents already use `gh` commands for issue processing
- ✅ **Workflow Labels**: Standardized GitHub labels for workflow progression
- ✅ **Role Specialization**: Agents have distinct responsibilities in 9-step workflow
- ⚠️ **Tech Stack Separation**: Currently minimal separation by technology
- ⚠️ **Spec Compliance**: No formal specification validation

## S.P.E.C Framework Analysis

### Research Decision: S.P.E.C Framework Interpretation
**Decision**: S.P.E.C framework refers to Specification-driven development with:
- **S**pecification: Formal agent behavior specifications
- **P**rocess: GitHub issue-driven workflow
- **E**xecution: Automated through GitHub Actions
- **C**ompliance: Validation and testing

**Rationale**: Based on context of "spec-driven development" and existing workflow patterns in the repository

**Alternatives Considered**:
- SPEC as acronym for other frameworks (rejected - no clear alternative meaning in context)
- Custom specification format (rejected - leverage existing markdown/YAML approach)

## Domain/Tech Stack Separation Research

### Research Decision: Agent Specialization Strategy
**Decision**: Create domain-specific variants of core agents:
- **Core agents**: requirements-analyst, documentation (domain-agnostic)
- **Architect variants**: solution-architect-python, solution-architect-dotnet, solution-architect-nodejs
- **Engineering variants**: software-engineer-python, software-engineer-dotnet, test-engineer-python, test-engineer-dotnet

**Rationale**:
- Maintains workflow consistency while allowing technology-specific expertise
- Follows existing pattern (test-engineer-python already exists)
- Enables specialized tool sets and best practices per stack

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single generic agents with parameters (rejected - reduces specialization benefits)
- Complete separate workflows per stack (rejected - complexity increase)

## GitHub Actions Integration Research

### Research Decision: Workflow Automation Approach
**Decision**: Create installable GitHub Actions workflows for:
- Agent specification validation
- Automated agent triggering based on issue labels
- Workflow progression monitoring
- Agent performance metrics collection

**Rationale**:
- GitHub Actions provide native CI/CD integration
- Installable workflows enable easy repository setup
- Event-driven triggers align with issue-based workflow

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Custom webhooks (rejected - additional infrastructure complexity)
- Manual agent invocation (rejected - reduces automation benefits)
- Third-party CI systems (rejected - GitHub-centric approach preferred)

## Agent Specification Format Research

### Research Decision: Specification Schema
**Decision**: Extend existing YAML frontmatter with specification sections:
- `spec_version`: Version for backward compatibility
- `domain`: Technology domain (python, dotnet, nodejs, agnostic)
- `inputs`: Expected GitHub issue format/labels
- `outputs`: Generated comments, labels, artifacts
- `validation`: Input validation rules
- `dependencies`: Required tools/environment

**Rationale**:
- Builds on existing markdown/YAML format
- Maintains backward compatibility
- Enables automated validation
- Supports domain specialization

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Separate specification files (rejected - increases file management complexity)
- JSON schema (rejected - YAML more human-readable)

## Backward Compatibility Research

### Research Decision: Migration Strategy
**Decision**: Incremental migration approach:
1. Add specification extensions to existing agents (backward compatible)
2. Create domain-specific variants for specialized agents
3. Implement validation as optional initially, then mandatory
4. Maintain existing agent names as aliases during transition

**Rationale**:
- Minimizes disruption to existing workflows
- Allows gradual adoption
- Maintains existing automation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Big-bang migration (rejected - high risk)
- Parallel system (rejected - maintenance complexity)

## GitHub Workflow Integration Research

### Research Decision: Installation Mechanism
**Decision**: Create `.github/workflows/` templates and installation script:
- `agent-validation.yml`: Validates agent specifications on PR
- `issue-automation.yml`: Triggers appropriate agents based on labels
- `agent-metrics.yml`: Collects workflow performance data
- Installation via `task install-workflows` command

**Rationale**:
- Standard GitHub conventions
- Easy repository setup
- Consistent across repositories using the templates

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Manual workflow setup (rejected - reduces adoption)
- Composite Actions (considered for future enhancement)

## Validation and Testing Research

### Research Decision: Specification Validation
**Decision**: Implement multi-layer validation:
- **Syntax validation**: YAML frontmatter schema compliance
- **Semantic validation**: Agent specification completeness
- **Integration testing**: End-to-end GitHub issue workflow testing
- **Performance testing**: Response time and accuracy metrics

**Rationale**:
- Ensures specification compliance
- Prevents runtime errors
- Maintains workflow quality
- Enables continuous improvement

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Runtime-only validation (rejected - late error detection)
- Manual testing only (rejected - scalability issues)

## Research Conclusions

### Ready for Implementation
All research areas have clear decisions with justified rationales. No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain.

### Key Implementation Insights
1. **Leverage Existing Infrastructure**: Build on current GitHub issue workflow
2. **Incremental Approach**: Minimize disruption while adding capabilities
