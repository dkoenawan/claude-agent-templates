# Specification Quality Checklist: Spec-Kit Integration and Project Pivot

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Clarifications Resolved**:

1. **FR-012** - Project value proposition clarified:
   - Target audience: Non-technical users with no development background
   - Core differentiation: Extends spec-kit with opinionated SDLC best practices
   - Key additions: Trunk-based development, atomic commits/components, specs with mocks/OpenAPI, IaC, monitoring (Datadog), guided decision-making
   - Philosophy: "spec-kit is almost there; we are extending and making some decisions for the users"

**Additional Requirements Added**:
- **FR-013**: Opinionated templates for SDLC best practices
- **FR-014**: Guide non-technical users with sensible defaults
- **FR-015**: Integrate agent development best practices with production SDLC

**Overall Status**: âœ… Specification is complete, validated, and ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`. All checklist items pass.
