### üéâ Major Milestone: Taskfile Migration Implementation

This release represents a significant architectural improvement with the implementation of a unified, cross-platform automation system using Taskfile, replacing the previous platform-specific shell scripts.

### Added
- **Cross-Platform Automation System**
  - Unified `Taskfile.yml` with comprehensive task definitions
  - `task install` - Install all agents to ~/.claude/agents directory
  - `task list` - Display available and installed agents with status
  - `task clean` - Remove installed agents with user confirmation
  - `task validate` - Verify agent installation and file integrity
  - `task update` - Update existing agent installations
  - `task help` - Comprehensive usage information and examples

- **Enhanced Repository Structure**
  - Created `docs/changelog/` directory for migration documentation
  - Added comprehensive `LICENSE.md` with MIT license
  - Structured documentation hierarchy for better organization

- **Documentation Improvements**
  - Updated `CLAUDE.md` with installation instructions and version information
  - Enhanced `docs/contributing.md` with Taskfile workflow integration
  - Added version consistency across all documentation files

### Changed
- **Installation Process**
  - Primary installation method now uses `task install` (cross-platform)
  - Legacy scripts (`install-agents.sh`, `install-agents.bat`) maintained for backward compatibility
  - Unified command interface regardless of operating system

- **Project Organization**
  - Moved `TASKFILE_MIGRATION.md` to `docs/changelog/` for better organization
  - Standardized documentation formatting and structure
  - Enhanced .gitignore to exclude Task binary (`bin/task`)

### Infrastructure
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**
  - Single automation system works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
  - Consistent behavior across all supported platforms
  - Reduced maintenance overhead from dual script implementations

- **Enhanced Functionality**
  - Expanded beyond basic installation to include management operations
  - Improved user experience with better feedback and error handling
  - Performance maintained within 10% of original scripts

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing shell scripts remain functional during transition period
- No breaking changes to current user workflows
- Deprecation warnings guide users to new Taskfile system

### Documentation
- Complete migration guide available in `docs/changelog/TASKFILE_MIGRATION.md`
- Updated installation instructions across all documentation
- Comprehensive troubleshooting section for common issues
