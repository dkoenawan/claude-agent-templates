# Arc42 Solution Architecture Template

This template guides solution architects in creating comprehensive architectural plans following arc42 principles.

## Section 4: Solution Strategy

### Architectural Approach
- **Architecture Style**: [Layered, hexagonal, microservices, etc.]
- **Key Patterns**: [Design patterns to be used]
- **Technology Stack**: [Programming languages, frameworks, databases]
- **Integration Strategy**: [How components communicate]

### Quality Achievement Strategy
For each top quality goal from requirements:
- **[Quality Goal 1]**: [How architecture achieves this]
- **[Quality Goal 2]**: [Specific architectural decisions]
- **[Quality Goal 3]**: [Patterns and practices used]

### Top-Level Decomposition
- **Domain Layer**: [Core business logic components]
- **Application Layer**: [Use cases and application services]
- **Infrastructure Layer**: [Technical concerns and external integrations]
- **Presentation Layer**: [User interfaces and APIs]

## Section 5: Building Block View

### Level 0: System Overview
```
[System Context Diagram]
External System A --> [Your System] --> External System B
                           |
                      User Interface
```

### Level 1: Component Architecture
- **Component A**: [Responsibility and interfaces]
- **Component B**: [Responsibility and interfaces]
- **Component C**: [Responsibility and interfaces]

### Level 2: Detailed Modules (if needed)
[Detailed breakdown of complex components]

## Section 6: Runtime View (Key Scenarios)

### Scenario 1: [Primary Use Case]
```
User --> UI --> Application Service --> Domain Logic --> Infrastructure
```
**Flow**: [Step-by-step interaction description]

### Scenario 2: [Error Handling]
**Flow**: [How errors are handled and propagated]

### Scenario 3: [Integration Flow]
**Flow**: [External system interactions]

## Section 9: Architectural Decisions

### Decision 1: [Decision Title]
- **Status**: [Accepted/Rejected/Deprecated]
- **Context**: [Situation requiring decision]
- **Decision**: [What was decided]
- **Rationale**: [Why this decision was made]
- **Consequences**: [Positive and negative outcomes]

### Decision 2: [Another Decision]
[Same format as above]

## Implementation Work Units

### Work Unit 1: [Component/Feature Name]
- **Acceptance Criteria**: [Specific measurable outcomes]
- **Dependencies**: [What must be completed first]
- **Estimated Complexity**: [Low/Medium/High]
- **Implementation Notes**: [Technical details for developers]

### Work Unit 2: [Next Component/Feature]
[Same format as above]

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Risk 1**: [Description] → **Mitigation**: [How to address]
- **Risk 2**: [Description] → **Mitigation**: [How to address]

### Integration Risks
- **Risk 1**: [External dependency concern] → **Mitigation**: [Fallback plan]
- **Risk 2**: [Performance concern] → **Mitigation**: [Monitoring strategy]

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Testing**: [Framework and coverage targets]
- **Integration Testing**: [Key integration points to test]
- **End-to-End Testing**: [Critical user scenarios]
- **Performance Testing**: [Load and performance requirements]

### Code Quality
- **Standards**: [Coding standards and linting rules]
- **Review Process**: [Code review requirements]
- **Documentation**: [Required documentation]

## Deployment Considerations

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Environment**: [Development, staging, production needs]
- **Scalability**: [How system scales with load]
- **Monitoring**: [What metrics to track]

### Migration Strategy (if applicable)
- **Data Migration**: [How existing data is handled]
- **Feature Rollout**: [Phased deployment approach]
- **Rollback Plan**: [How to revert if needed]

## Output Format

When architectural planning is complete, provide:

```markdown
