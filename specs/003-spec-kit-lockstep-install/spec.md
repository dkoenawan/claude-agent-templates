# Feature Specification: Spec-Kit Lockstep Installation

**Feature Branch**: `003-spec-kit-lockstep-install`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "lockstep installation to github spec-kit. As this is an extension to GitHub spec-kit. We need to lockstep the installation of this github project with the spec-kit. i.e. we need to provide a way for user to install this programme (and automatically install spec-kit of a specified version). This way we can manage spec-kit upgrade and ensure that no upgrade from spec-kit will results in a breaking version of our claude-agent-templates."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Single Command Installation (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to install claude-agent-templates and have all dependencies (including the correct version of spec-kit) automatically configured without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - eliminating manual dependency management and version conflicts. Without this, users face breaking changes when spec-kit updates.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the installation command on a fresh system and verifying that both claude-agent-templates and the pinned spec-kit version are correctly installed and functional.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a system without claude-agent-templates or spec-kit, **When** user runs the installation command, **Then** both claude-agent-templates and the specified spec-kit version are installed successfully
2. **Given** a system with an older spec-kit version, **When** user installs claude-agent-templates, **Then** the spec-kit version is updated to the pinned compatible version
3. **Given** installation completes, **When** user runs a spec-kit command, **Then** the command executes successfully with the correct spec-kit version

---

### User Story 2 - Version Compatibility Management (Priority: P2)

A maintainer needs to update the pinned spec-kit version when a new compatible release is available, ensuring users always get a tested combination.

**Why this priority**: This ensures long-term maintainability and allows controlled upgrades without breaking user installations.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by updating the spec-kit version pin, running compatibility tests, and verifying that new installations receive the updated version.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new spec-kit version is released, **When** maintainer updates the version pin and publishes, **Then** new installations use the updated spec-kit version
2. **Given** the version pin is updated, **When** existing users re-run installation, **Then** their spec-kit version is upgraded to the new pinned version
3. **Given** a spec-kit version is pinned, **When** user checks installed versions, **Then** they can clearly see which spec-kit version is in use

---

### User Story 3 - Upgrade Path Management (Priority: P3)

An existing user wants to upgrade claude-agent-templates and receive the appropriate spec-kit version for the new release without breaking their workflow.

**Why this priority**: This provides a smooth upgrade experience and maintains the lockstep guarantee over time.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating an upgrade from an older claude-agent-templates version and verifying that spec-kit is upgraded appropriately and existing workflows continue to function.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has an older claude-agent-templates version installed, **When** they upgrade to the latest version, **Then** spec-kit is automatically updated to the compatible pinned version
2. **Given** user upgrades, **When** spec-kit version conflicts exist, **Then** user receives clear error messages explaining the conflict and resolution steps
3. **Given** upgrade completes successfully, **When** user runs existing workflows, **Then** all workflows continue to function without breaking changes

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the pinned spec-kit version is no longer available in the upstream repository?
- How does the system handle network failures during spec-kit installation?
- What happens when user has manually installed a different spec-kit version that conflicts with the pinned version?
- How does the system handle partial installation failures (claude-agent-templates succeeds but spec-kit fails)?
- What happens when user doesn't have necessary permissions to install dependencies?
- How does the system behave on different operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST specify a pinned spec-kit version in a version manifest file
- **FR-002**: Installation process MUST automatically detect and install the pinned spec-kit version if not present
- **FR-003**: Installation process MUST verify that installed spec-kit version matches the pinned version
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear error messages when spec-kit version conflicts are detected
- **FR-005**: System MUST support upgrading spec-kit version when claude-agent-templates is upgraded
- **FR-006**: Installation process MUST validate that spec-kit installation completed successfully before completing
- **FR-007**: System MUST document the spec-kit version compatibility in user-facing documentation
- **FR-008**: Installation process MUST handle cases where user has pre-existing spec-kit installation
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a command to check current spec-kit version and compatibility status
- **FR-010**: System MUST support rollback if spec-kit installation fails during upgrade

### Key Entities

- **Version Manifest**: Configuration file that specifies the pinned spec-kit version, minimum/maximum compatible versions, and version constraints
- **Installation Script**: Executable that orchestrates the installation of claude-agent-templates and spec-kit dependencies
- **Compatibility Checker**: Component that verifies installed spec-kit version matches requirements and reports conflicts
- **Version Lock**: Record of installed component versions for validation and upgrade management

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can install claude-agent-templates with correct spec-kit version in a single command execution
- **SC-002**: Installation success rate exceeds 95% across supported platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **SC-003**: Version conflicts are detected and reported with clear resolution steps in 100% of cases
- **SC-004**: Upgrade process maintains backward compatibility for existing workflows in 100% of test cases
- **SC-005**: Users can verify version compatibility status in under 5 seconds
- **SC-006**: Installation documentation is clear enough that 90% of users complete installation without requiring support
- **SC-007**: Zero breaking changes occur from uncontrolled spec-kit upgrades after lockstep installation is implemented

## Dependencies *(mandatory)*

### External Dependencies

- GitHub spec-kit repository and release management
- Package manager availability (npm, pip, or similar depending on implementation)
- Network connectivity for downloading spec-kit during installation

### Assumptions

- Spec-kit uses semantic versioning for releases
- Spec-kit releases are published to a public repository accessible via standard package managers
- Users have basic command-line access and permissions to install software
- Installation process has network access to download dependencies
- Standard installation methods (package managers) are used rather than custom binary distribution

### Constraints

- Installation process must not require manual configuration of spec-kit version
- Version pinning must be updateable by maintainers without breaking existing installations
- Solution must work across multiple operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Installation must complete in under 5 minutes on standard network connections
