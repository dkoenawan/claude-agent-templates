# Feature Specification: Agent Refactoring for Spec-Driven Development with GitHub Issues Interface

**Feature Branch**: `001-refactor-the-agent`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "refactor the agent in the agents folder to follow spec-driven development approach that can be interfaced by the user through github issues"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature requires refactoring existing agents to use spec-driven development
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: developers, users, agents; Actions: refactor, interface; Data: specifications, issues, agents
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific agent(s) need refactoring - all agents or specific ones?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What spec format should be used - existing template or new format?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flow: create issue ’ agent processes using specs ’ delivers results
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (specifications, agents, GitHub issues)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties about specific agent scope"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the Claude Agent Templates repository, I want agents to follow a specification-driven development approach so that I can interface with them through GitHub issues in a predictable, standardized way, ensuring consistent behavior and clear expectations across all agent interactions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a GitHub issue is created with a feature request, **When** an agent processes the issue, **Then** the agent follows a predefined specification document that defines its behavior, inputs, outputs, and interaction patterns
2. **Given** multiple agents exist in the repository, **When** users interact with any agent through GitHub issues, **Then** all agents follow the same specification-driven interface standards for consistency
3. **Given** an agent specification exists, **When** the agent processes a GitHub issue, **Then** the agent's behavior matches exactly what is documented in its specification
4. **Given** a user creates a GitHub issue, **When** the appropriate agent is triggered, **Then** the agent responds according to its specification including proper labeling, commenting, and workflow progression

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an agent receives a GitHub issue that doesn't match its specification requirements?
- How does the system handle conflicting specifications between different agents?
- What occurs when an agent specification is updated while active issues are in progress?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain specification documents for each agent that define their behavior, inputs, outputs, and GitHub issue interaction patterns
- **FR-002**: Agents MUST follow their specification documents when processing GitHub issues, ensuring consistent and predictable behavior
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to interface with agents exclusively through GitHub issues using standardized formats defined in specifications
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear specification templates that agents can follow for GitHub issue processing workflows
- **FR-005**: Agents MUST validate GitHub issue inputs against their specifications before processing
- **FR-006**: System MUST ensure all agents follow the same specification-driven interface standards for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: consistency level not specified - strict enforcement vs guidelines?]
- **FR-007**: Agents MUST handle GitHub issues according to their specifications including proper [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific GitHub actions not defined - labeling, commenting, status updates?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST support specification updates without breaking existing agent functionality for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: backward compatibility requirements not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Agent Specification**: Document defining agent behavior, inputs, outputs, and GitHub issue interaction patterns for consistent processing
- **GitHub Issue**: User-created request that triggers agent processing according to specification requirements
- **Agent**: Automated process that follows its specification to handle GitHub issues in a predictable manner
- **Specification Template**: Standardized format for creating agent specifications ensuring consistency across all agents
