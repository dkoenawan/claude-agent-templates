# Data Model: Agent Refactoring for Spec-Driven Development

## Core Entities

### Agent Specification
**Purpose**: Defines the behavior, capabilities, and interface contract for an agent

**Attributes**:
- `name`: Unique identifier for the agent (e.g., "solution-architect-python")
- `description`: Human-readable description of agent purpose and capabilities
- `spec_version`: Specification schema version for compatibility management
- `domain`: Technology domain classification (python, dotnet, nodejs, agnostic)
- `role`: Workflow role (analyst, architect, engineer, documentation)
- `tools`: List of available tools the agent can use
- `model`: AI model configuration (inherit, specific model)
- `color`: UI color coding for agent identification

**Extended Specification Attributes**:
- `inputs`: Expected GitHub issue format, labels, and content structure
- `outputs`: Generated artifacts (comments, labels, files, PR actions)
- `validation`: Input validation rules and error handling
- `dependencies`: Required tools, environment, and system dependencies
- `workflow_position`: Position in the 9-step development workflow
- `github_integration`: GitHub-specific configuration and permissions

**Relationships**:
- Belongs to a Domain (many-to-one)
- Has many Workflow Steps
- Has many Validation Rules

### Domain
**Purpose**: Technology stack or specialization area for agent grouping

**Attributes**:
- `name`: Domain identifier (python, dotnet, nodejs, agnostic)
- `description`: Domain description and scope
- `default_tools`: Common tools available across domain agents
- `validation_schema`: Domain-specific validation requirements

**Relationships**:
- Has many Agents (one-to-many)
- Has many Domain-specific Tools

### GitHub Issue Context
**Purpose**: Structured representation of GitHub issue data for agent processing

**Attributes**:
- `issue_number`: GitHub issue identifier
- `title`: Issue title
- `body`: Issue description content
- `labels`: Applied GitHub labels for workflow state
- `assignees`: Issue assignees
- `milestone`: Associated milestone
- `workflow_state`: Current position in development workflow
- `agent_context`: Previous agent interactions and outputs

**Relationships**:
- Processed by Agent (many-to-many through Workflow Steps)
- Has many Agent Interactions

### Agent Interaction
**Purpose**: Record of agent processing on a GitHub issue

**Attributes**:
- `agent_name`: Agent that processed the issue
- `timestamp`: Processing timestamp
- `input_validation`: Validation results and errors
- `outputs_generated`: List of artifacts created
- `workflow_progression`: Workflow state changes
- `performance_metrics`: Processing time and success metrics

**Relationships**:
- Belongs to GitHub Issue Context
- Belongs to Agent Specification

### Workflow Step
**Purpose**: Defines agent behavior at specific workflow positions

**Attributes**:
- `step_number`: Position in 9-step workflow (1-9)
- `step_name`: Descriptive name (e.g., "Requirements Analysis")
- `input_requirements`: Required inputs for this step
- `output_specifications`: Expected outputs and formats
- `success_criteria`: Conditions for step completion
- `failure_handling`: Error scenarios and recovery actions

**Relationships**:
- Belongs to Agent Specification
- Has many Validation Rules

### Validation Rule
**Purpose**: Defines validation logic for agent inputs and outputs

**Attributes**:
- `rule_type`: Type of validation (syntax, semantic, business)
- `rule_expression`: Validation logic or schema
- `error_message`: User-friendly error description
- `severity`: Error severity (error, warning, info)
- `auto_fix`: Whether automatic correction is possible

**Relationships**:
- Belongs to Agent Specification or Workflow Step

## State Transitions

### GitHub Issue Workflow States
```
1. issue-created → 2. requirements-analysis
2. requirements-analysis → 3. requirements-ready
3. requirements-ready → 4. plan-approved
4. plan-approved → 5. tests-planned
5. tests-planned → 6. implementation-ready
6. implementation-ready → 7. implementation-complete
7. implementation-complete → 8. user-accepted
8. user-accepted → 9. documentation-complete
```

### Agent Processing States
```
idle → triggered → validating → processing → generating-outputs → completed
idle → triggered → validating → validation-failed → error-state
```

## Validation Rules

### Agent Specification Validation
- **Syntax**: YAML frontmatter must be valid
- **Completeness**: Required fields (name, description, domain, role) must be present
- **Domain Consistency**: Domain must match available domain list
- **Tool Availability**: Listed tools must be available in the environment
- **Specification Version**: Must be compatible with current schema version

### GitHub Issue Input Validation
- **Format**: Issue must contain required sections for agent type
- **Labels**: Required workflow labels must be present
- **Content**: Issue body must meet minimum content requirements
- **Dependencies**: Previous workflow steps must be completed

### Output Validation
- **Format**: Generated outputs must match specification schema
- **Completeness**: All required output artifacts must be generated
- **Quality**: Generated content must meet quality thresholds
- **GitHub Integration**: API calls must succeed and generate expected results

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Agent specifications cached in memory for repeated use
- GitHub API responses cached for issue context
- Validation results cached to avoid recomputation

### Scalability Factors
- Agent processing designed for concurrent execution
- Workflow state management prevents race conditions
- Resource isolation between different agent types

### Monitoring Points
- Agent response times per workflow step
- Validation failure rates by agent and domain
- GitHub API rate limiting and usage patterns
- Workflow completion rates and bottlenecks
