# Feature Specification: Spec-Kit Integration and Project Pivot

**Feature Branch**: `002-spec-kit-integration`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "pivot project structure to incorporate GitHub spec-kit and Claude skills"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Adopt GitHub Spec-Kit Standards (Priority: P1)

As a developer contributing to the project, I want the codebase to follow GitHub's spec-kit standards so that I can leverage standardized tools and workflows that align with industry best practices.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation for the pivot - without adopting spec-kit standards, the project cannot integrate with the spec-kit ecosystem or leverage its automation capabilities.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying that the project structure follows spec-kit conventions (feature directories, spec.md files, workflow commands) and delivers the ability to run spec-kit commands like `/speckit.specify` and `/speckit.plan`.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the current project structure, **When** I examine the directory layout, **Then** I see feature specs organized in a `.specify/` or `specs/` directory following spec-kit conventions
2. **Given** I want to create a new feature specification, **When** I run the spec-kit command for creating specs, **Then** the system generates a properly formatted spec.md file with all required sections
3. **Given** I want to understand the project workflow, **When** I review the documentation, **Then** I see clear alignment with spec-kit principles (spec-driven development, feature isolation, testability)

### User Story 2 - Integrate Claude Skills (Priority: P2)

As a Claude Code user, I want to leverage Claude skills for specialized workflows so that I can access domain-specific capabilities and reusable automation patterns.

**Why this priority**: Claude skills provide extensibility and reusability, but they build upon the spec-driven foundation established in P1.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating and invoking a Claude skill, verifying it executes correctly and delivers specialized functionality beyond the base system.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a specialized workflow need, **When** I create a Claude skill with the appropriate configuration, **Then** the skill is available for invocation in the project
2. **Given** an existing Claude skill, **When** I invoke it using the skill command, **Then** it executes its defined workflow and produces expected outputs
3. **Given** multiple skills installed, **When** I request a list of available skills, **Then** I see all installed skills with their descriptions and usage information

---

### User Story 3 - Maintain GitHub Issues Workflow Integration (Priority: P3)

As a project maintainer, I want to preserve the existing GitHub Issues-based workflow automation so that users can continue to interact with agents through familiar issue labels and workflows.

**Why this priority**: This ensures backward compatibility and leverages existing automation investment, but is lower priority than establishing the new spec-kit foundation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a GitHub issue with appropriate labels and verifying that the workflow automation triggers correctly and produces expected artifacts.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new GitHub issue with feature request, **When** appropriate labels are applied, **Then** the issue workflow automatically creates a feature branch and initializes spec files following spec-kit structure
2. **Given** an issue in the requirements phase, **When** the requirements analysis completes, **Then** the issue is updated with spec references and transitions to the appropriate workflow state
3. **Given** compatibility concerns between old agents and new spec-kit structure, **When** workflows execute, **Then** they successfully bridge both approaches without errors

---

### User Story 4 - Preserve Multi-Domain Agent Framework (Priority: P2)

As a developer working across different technology stacks, I want the project to maintain support for domain-specific agents (Python, .NET, Node.js, Java) so that I can get contextually appropriate guidance regardless of my technology choice.

**Why this priority**: The multi-domain agent framework is a key differentiator, but needs to be reconciled with spec-kit standards to remain valuable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by invoking a domain-specific agent (e.g., Python software engineer) and verifying it provides technology-appropriate guidance while following spec-kit workflows.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I'm working on a Python feature, **When** the requirements analyst classifies my issue, **Then** it correctly identifies the domain and assigns Python-specific agents for subsequent phases
2. **Given** domain-specific agents exist for Python, .NET, Node.js, and Java, **When** I review agent specifications, **Then** each agent follows spec-kit format while maintaining domain-specific expertise
3. **Given** a cross-domain project, **When** workflows execute, **Then** agents can collaborate across domains while maintaining their specialized knowledge

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a feature doesn't clearly map to a single technology domain (e.g., full-stack feature spanning frontend and backend)?
- How does the system handle conflicts between existing agent specifications and spec-kit requirements?
- What happens when GitHub's spec-kit tools evolve and introduce breaking changes?
- How does the system handle features that require both Claude skills and GitHub workflow automation?
- What happens when users want to use the project without GitHub (local development only)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Project structure MUST follow GitHub spec-kit conventions for organizing feature specifications and workflows
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide commands for creating, planning, and implementing features using spec-kit methodology
- **FR-003**: System MUST support Claude skills integration for specialized and reusable workflows
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing GitHub Issues-based automation workflows
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve multi-domain agent framework (Python, .NET, Node.js, Java, core) while adapting to spec-kit standards
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear migration path for existing agents to spec-kit-compatible format
